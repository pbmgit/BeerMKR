Parts

MicroSD for Raspberry Pi (32G at least)

2.5mm jack to plug in second temperature probe.  I liked these better than anything on Amazon.  I have it mounted on the left side of my BeerMKR https://www.ebay.com/itm/274570248806

The meat probe I used is gone off of Amazon.  It would be something like this: https://a.co/d/guGDll9.  Needs to be food safe.
